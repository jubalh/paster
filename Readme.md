At my current workplace I have to use Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Express which doesn't support Macros.
Above every function which we write in our C code we have a header. Because I didn't want to scroll up (or down) to the last one and copy it (then i would have to delete some of the old text, replace the username, and search for the head in the first place..) I wanted to paste it just with a simple key stroke.

Fortunately I found some free time to code this little program which does exactly that.
It simulates keystrokes.
Up to now it's all in the code, nothing configurable, due to I haven't found _that_ much time ;-)
